## Backstory

Iâ€™ve been enamoured of the Drift screensaver ever since it came out with macOS Catalina. Itâ€™s mesmerizing. I feel like itâ€™s become an instant classic, and, dare I say, it might stand to dethrone the venerable Flurry screensaver. Hats off to the folk at Apple responsible for this gem ðŸ™Œ.

This is an attempt at capturing that magic and bottling it up in a more portable vessel. This isnâ€™t a port though. The source code for the original is locked up in a spaceship somewhere in Cupertino. Instead, consider this a delicate blend of detective work and artistic liberty. Itâ€™s WebGL2 for now, but [WebGPU](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) is shaping up nicely, so native ports arenâ€™t off the books.


## Build

### Using Nix

Build a new release in the `result` folder:

```sh
nix build
```

Or open a development shell with all the neccessary tools:

```sh
nix develop

cd web
yarn serve
```

### Manual build

Thereâ€™s a few things youâ€™re going to have to install.

- rustc with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` as a target
- cargo
- wasm-pack
- node
- pnpm or yarn
- elm

How you get these dependencies depends on the operating system youâ€™re running. Hereâ€™s an example for macOS and Linux using rustup:

```sh
rustup toolchain install stable
rustup target wasm32-unknown-unknown

cd web
pnpm install
```

Run a development server from the `web` folder:
```sh
pnpm serve
```

Build a release:
```sh
pnpm build
```
