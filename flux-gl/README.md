# Flux on GL

Legacy GL-based Flux library, desktop app, and WASM wrapper.

These will no longer receive feature updates and have been superceded by their WebGPU counterparts.

The only benefit of these versions is that they can run on much older hardware.
The mininum requirements are WebGL2, which translates to OpenGL ES 3.0 or OpenGL Core 3.3.
